# Finite-difference-scheme-Laplace-equation
A finite difference scheme to numerically solve laplace's equation created for MATLAB.
Laplace's equation is a PDE.
Laplace's equation can be used to model potentials, and has many uses in electrodynamics.
This relaxation method is called Jacobi's method. Other methods could be used to solve the Laplace equation.
