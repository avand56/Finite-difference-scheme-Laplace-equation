# Finite difference scheme for Laplace's equation
A finite difference scheme to numerically solve laplace's equation written in MATLAB.
Laplace's equation is a 2nd order elliptic PDE that is a special case of the Helmholtz equation. 
It can be solved analytically using separation of variables.
Laplace's equation can be used to model potentials and phenomena that reach equilibrium.

# Electrodynamics
Laplace's equation can be used to model problems in electrostatics, fluid mechanics, and gravitation.
The code used here models the electric field caused by a
This relaxation method is called Jacobi's method. Other methods could be used to solve the Laplace equation.
